This is an AI generated Minecraft texture pack created with neuralblender.com in September 2021.

At the time of generating there was no licensing information or restrictions on the site, so I created this.

The prompts were just the texture name, without the file extension.

Texture names were taken from Mineraft version 1.17.1

### DISCLAIMER: Some of the textures may be considered NSFW, although they do not depict anything clearly recognisable. The images are not filtered or cherry-picked.
